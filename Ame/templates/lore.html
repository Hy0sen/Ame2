          Passion is found at a young age they say, everyone has to start somewhere well at the point of me writing this I still have not accompolished much per se.. <br>
          but still I have passed high school, managed to get in a decent enough college and am still motivated enough to continue pursuing my passion. What entails is not <br>
          a very interesting tale but nevertheless it is a memory that I cherish and I will continue to until forever.<br><br>
          Way back in 3rd grade I got gifted a set of encyclopedias, from my cousin. And among that miniature system I found a star which was going to change my life<br>
          The book about space that's it, as simple as that. Everything in that book was something that I fell in love with instantly, too young to understand anything but<br>
          what pulled me in(literally) were the vivid illustrations of the mysterious black holes, beautiful nebuals, grand galaxies, the marvellous machines that we call rockets, everything.<br>
          Ever since, I made it my life's goal to become an astronaut and this single goal of mine has managed to <br>
          keep me going no matter what and it is something I am truly grateful for...........<br><br>

          <p>
            "Remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet.<br> 
            Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist.<br>
            Be curious. And however difficult life may seem,<br> 
            there is always something you can do and succeed at. It matters that you donâ€™t just give up."<br>
